Report: Image Captioning with Generative AI
1. Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a web application that generates captions for images using a pre-trained Transformer-based model. The application allows users to upload images and receive descriptive captions generated by the model. Additionally, the project includes a functionality to scrape images from a webpage and generate captions for those images as well.

2. Libraries Used
* Gradio: Used to create a user-friendly web interface for the image captioning application. Gradio simplifies the process of creating web apps for machine learning models by providing an easy-to-use interface for input and output.
* Transformers: Provides the necessary models and processors to generate captions. Specifically, the project uses the BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining) model for image captioning.
* Pillow (PIL): Used for image processing tasks, such as opening, manipulating, and converting image formats. It converts images to the required RGB format for processing by the model.
* Torch: Provides the core functionalities required to run the Transformer models. Torch is a deep-learning library that enables model loading, input processing, and inference.
* BeautifulSoup (bs4): Used for web scraping. It parses HTML and XML documents and helps extract images from web pages.

3. Software & Environment
* Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
* Jupyter Notebook: Used for code development and testing.
* Gradio Interface: Deployed locally using Gradioâ€™s web interface capabilities.

4. Work Done

* Installed required libraries (gradio, transformers, Pillow, requests, torch, and beautifulsoup4).
* Loaded the pretrained BLIP model and processor from the transformers library.
* Building the Image Captioning Functionality:
* Developed a function to take an image as input, preprocess it, and generate a caption using the BLIP model.
* Created a Gradio interface to interact with the image captioning function, allowing users to upload an image and receive a caption as output.
* Implemented a web scraping script to download images from a specified webpage.
* Processed each image using the BLIP model to generate captions.
* Logged the captions along with their respective image URLs in a text file.

5. Outputs
* The Gradio web application allows users to upload an image and receive a generated caption.
* The script successfully downloaded images from the provided webpage and generated captions for them.
