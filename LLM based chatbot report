Objective:
* Develop a web-based chatbot that engages in human-like conversations using a pre-trained language model, integrated with a Flask server.

Tools and Libraries:
* Flask: Web framework for serving the chatbot application.
* Flask-CORS: Enables cross-origin requests.
* Transformers: Provides the pre-trained "facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill" model.
* PyTorch: Deep learning framework for running the model.

Implementation:
* Configured a basic Flask server with endpoints for home and chatbot interaction.
* Enabled CORS to handle cross-origin requests.
* Loaded the "facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill" model using the Transformers library.
* Tokenized input and conversation history to generate context-aware responses.
* Maintained conversation history to ensure continuity in dialogue.
* Designed an API endpoint (/chatbot) to process user input and return the chatbotâ€™s response.

Results:
* The chatbot application functions effectively, generating coherent responses based on ongoing conversation context.
